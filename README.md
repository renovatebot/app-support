# WhiteSource Renovate App Support

We use issues in this repository to discuss problems or feature requests that are directly related to the hosted app and not to the open source or self-hosted versions of Renovate.

GitHub allows the free transfer of issues within the same org, so don't worry too much about which repository you create an issue in first - we can transfer it to the main repo if we conclude it needs a core code fix, or vice versa.
